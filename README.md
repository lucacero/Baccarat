I created this program with the intent of figuring out an optimal betting structure for the casino game Baccarat.
After running billions of simulations, I discovered something extremely crucial. That crucial thing being it is 
impossible to "beat" the game Baccarat, as the casino's edge will eat into your bankroll. I setup this program as
a response to a particular casino's Baccarat format that I believed was beatable. I discovered their complicated edge,
but still found a way to "beat" their game. I ended up making $3,200 USD of profit from this, however my strategy can 
not beat Baccarat in the long run. This is a very interesting game to me, and I hope you can use this program to discover 
a gppd strategy for you. I am done with Baccarat. Thank you.
